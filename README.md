Than this is the option for you. The Boss randomizer changes the story boss encounters with a few configurable options.

### Future Plans

- Currently Secret (Will expand as new information is found)

## Known Issues

- Certain combinations of bosses will cause the music that plays during the boss fight to be battle 1.

### Usage
Head over to the releases section and download the latest version of the randomizer. Extract its contents somewhere, and run the executable inside.  
Find the pak dir of your Octopath Traveler installation, usually located under
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\OCTOPATH TRAVELER\Octopath_Traveler\Content\Paks
```
Pick the options you want, and click randomize. The program will randomize the bosses, and place a patch pak file and a spoiler log in a subdir
named "BossRandomizer" in the pak dir.
