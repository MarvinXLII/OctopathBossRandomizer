# OctopathBossRandomizer
Boss Randomizer for Octopath Traveler (Steam)

### About
This is a work in progress for a boss randomizer in Octopath Traveler

### Features
Currently this randomizer only randomizes among similar tier chapter bosses and configurable randomizers for the shrine bosses and Gate of Finis Bosses.
Setting other options do nothing.

### Future Plans

- Options for randomizing between chapters tiers
- Option for entering seeds to generate the same random options and verification
- Better formating for Spoiler file
- GUI

### Usage
Head over to the releases section and download the latest version of the randomizer. Extract its contents somewhere, and run the executable inside. 
This will produce a file called "RandomizedBosses_P.pak". Place this file in the pak folder of Octopath Traveler, usually located under
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\OCTOPATH TRAVELER\Octopath_Traveler\Content\Paks
```
