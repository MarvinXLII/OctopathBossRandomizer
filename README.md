# OctopathBossRandomizer
Boss Randomizer for Octopath Traveler (Steam)

### About
This is a work in progress for a boss randomizer in Octopath Traveler

### Features
Currently this randomizer only randomizes among similar tier chapter bosses, shrine bosses, and Gate of Finis bosses. 
Also allows for including the shrine bosses, Gate of Finis bosses, and Galdera with chapter 4 story bosses.

### Future Plans

- Options for randomizing between chapters tiers
- Option for entering seeds to generate the same random options and verification
- Better formating for Spoiler file
- GUI

### Usage
Head over to the releases section and download the latest version of the randomizer. Extract its contents somewhere, and run the executable inside. 
This will produce a file called "RandomizedBosses_P.pak". Place this file in the pak folder of Octopath Traveler, usually located under
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\OCTOPATH TRAVELER\Octopath_Traveler\Content\Paks
```
